ðŸ‘‹Heyy, I'm @nitinshrinivas !!

I'm a student of IIIT-H pursuing my BTech (Hons.) in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I'm also an undergraduate researcher working under the guidance of Praful D. Mankar in the Signal Processing and Communication Reaseach Center known by the name SPCRC, IIIT-H. Currently, I work in the area of Age of Information (AoI) which has a very great use in real time status update of the IoT systems.
